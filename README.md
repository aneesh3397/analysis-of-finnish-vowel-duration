# analysis-of-finnish-vowel-duration

The data used here comes from Myers and Hansen (2005, 2007). The data can be found in finnishVowelDuration.txt. They consist of measurements of vowel duration under a number of conditions taken from recordings of four Finnish speakers. The column labeled “Token” is the items, “duration” is the total vowel duration, “length” is a binary variable identifying short versus long vowels, “syllType” is a non-binary categorical variable showing the shape of the syllable that the vowel occurred in, “position” is a binary variable identifying the position of the vowel in the word, “speaker” identifies the four different speakers, “sanoiDur” is the duration of the word “sanoi” which immediately preceded the word containing the measured vowel in the recording, and finally “vcdDur” is the duration of the voiced portion of the vowel.

This project analyses this data in terms of central tendancies, spread and relationships between the various conditions.
